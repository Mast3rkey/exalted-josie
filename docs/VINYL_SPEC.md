- 180g vinyl
- 33 1/3 RPM (unless runtime requires otherwise)

## Audio / Mastering Delivery
- One vinyl-optimized master (side breaks considered)

## Packaging
- Jacket: sturdy, high-quality print (matte preferred)
- Inner sleeve: anti-static or printed inner (decision later)
- Inserts (required):
  - Liner notes / credits
  - Profit statement (how the split works)

## Numbering
- Each copy signed or hand-numbered by the artists (decision: signature vs number only)
