# JOSIE — RELEASE CONSTITUTION

## Purpose
Josie is released as a complete artistic statement, owned and controlled by the artists who created it.

## Artists
Exalted consists of five artists:

- Nick Masters — piano  
- Marvin “Bugalu” Smith — spiritual drumming  
- Oscar Williams II — key bass  
- Nick Frank — saxophone  
- Ben Frank — flute  

## Ownership & Profits
- All revenue flows into a single transparent pool.
- All direct costs are deducted openly.
- Remaining net profits are split **equally** among the five artists.
- No recoup hierarchy. No deferred credits. No exceptions.

## Release Format
- Vinyl is the primary and definitive format.
- The pressing is limited and hand-numbered.
- Digital access is provided directly to listeners as a companion, not a substitute.

## Digital Philosophy
- No public streaming platforms at launch.
- No DRM systems that punish legitimate listeners.
- Digital files are distributed privately and responsibly.
- Trust between artist and listener is part of the work.

## Distribution
- Direct-to-listener only.
- No label involvement.
- No intermediaries extracting value.

## Final Principle
Every decision must answer one question:

Would this still make sense if only 300 people ever hear this record?

If the answer is no, the decision is rejected.
